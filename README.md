# Philippine Tech Community Leaders Oath
*as of December 8, 2018*

As a leader of **< community >**, I, **< name >**, am the one that upholds the mission, vision, and values of our community. Given this responsibility, I will serve what’s best for my community and not for my personal gain. 

I will always remember that the community is not just me but i’m just one of the members of the whole community.

I will not abuse, misrepresent, or do any harm toward our tech communities. I will try to make our community and events inclusive to all. I will make sure that I protect our members if someone violates our code of conduct.

As a tech leader, I will empower the members of the Filipino tech communities to lead and be their best in their chosen field. I will be an example and inspiration to our community members in order for them to be a better developer, engineer, designer, manager, leader and more.

I will be the bearer of change in order for us to push our country’s technology forward.

## Instructions

To add your name or your community to the pledge, update this README directly if you are part of this organization in Github. If not, fork the README, then add your name or your community name as a url link and create a pull request (Url markdown looks like this `[name](url)`). Please add your name under the date that you have pledge the Oath. Create another date as needed.

It would be better if you would be using your own Github Account when adding your name in the pledge. This acts like a signature because most likely only you have the access to your account.

If you want to add or request any changes in our Oath, please create an issue and tell us why you want to add or change the certain section and we'll vote for the changes. 

Thank you for being part of our movement. :)

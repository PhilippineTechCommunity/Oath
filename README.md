I will always remember that the community is not just me but i’m just one of the members of the whole community.

I will not abuse, misrepresent, or do any harm toward our tech communities. I will try to make our community and events inclusive to all. I will make sure that I protect our members if someone violates our code of conduct.

As a tech leader, I will empower the members of the Filipino tech communities to lead and be their best in their chosen field. I will be an example and inspiration to our community members in order for them to be a better developer, engineer, designer, manager, leader and more.

I will be the bearer of change in order for us to push our country’s technology forward.
